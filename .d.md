.d
==

Many services in Linux have a configuration arrangement where there is a config
file and then a related `.d` subdirectory. For example:

```console
$ ls -la /etc
-rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1358  Jan 30  2018  syslog.conf
drwxr-xr-x  2  root  root  4096  Oct 18 10:06  syslog.d
-r--m-----  1  root  root   755  Aug 23 11:56  sudoers
drwxr-xr-x  2  root  root  4096  Oct 18 10:08  sudoers.d
...
```

This enables global config setting in the config file (here `syslog.conf` or
`sudoers`) but app-specific settings can be set by adding a config file into the
`.d` subdirectory.

This makes it much easier to deploy an app over multiple servers (add a file to
a directory instead of trying to edit a possibly locked system file). It also
reduces the risk of one program overwriting the settings of another program.
