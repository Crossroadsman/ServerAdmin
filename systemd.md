What is systemd
---------------
From the [homepage][systemd_home]:  
> systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system.  
> It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.  
> Other parts include a logging daemon, utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale, maintain a list 
> of logged-in users and running containers and virtual machines, system accounts, runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage 
> simple network configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name resolution. 




How It Works
------------
systemd decides what to launch by looking at 'service' ('unit') files. These files describe how systemd should execute a particular
service. Note the service itself can be in any format that the system can execute, from shell scripts to application binaries.

Example of a valid systemd service file:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn server for staging.mysite.com

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
User=myuser
WorkingDirectory=/home/myuser/sites/staging.mysite.com
EnvironmentFile=/home/myuser/sites/staging.mysite.com/.env

ExecStart=/home/myuser/sites/staging.mysite.com/venv/bin/gunicorn \
    --bind unix:/tmp/staging.mysite.com.socket \
    superlists.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `Unit` section describes what the file is and (optionally) when to run. The `Service` section describes what we actually want to 
run.

The `Install` section describes positive and negative dependencies in either direction.

Service files must have the `.service` extension and custom service config files (i.e., user-created) are saved in 
`/etc/systemd/system`.

They can be started with `systemctl start myservice.service`.



systemctl Examples
------------------
### Check the version ###
```console
$ systemctl --version
systemd 237
+PAM +AUDIT +SELINUX +IMA +APPARMOR +SMACK +SYSVINIT +UTMP +LIBCRYPTSETUP +GCRYPT +GNUTLS +ACL +XZ +LZ4 +SECCOMP +BLKID +ELFUTILS 
+KMOD -IDN2 +IDN -PCRE2 default-hierarchy=hybrid
```

### Check the Status of Services ###
```console
$ systemctl
...
ufw.service  loaded active       exited      Uncomplicated firewall
ntpd.service loaded maintenance  maintenance Network Time Service
...
```

### Check the Status of a Specific Service ###
```console
$ systemctl status ufw.service
‚óè ufw.service - Uncomplicated firewall
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ufw.service; enabled; vendor preset: enab
   Active: active (exited) since Wed 2018-11-07 14:18:04 MST; 1 day 5h ago
     Docs: man:ufw(8)
 Main PID: 391 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    Tasks: 0 (limit: 1110)
   CGroup: /system.slice/ufw.service

Warning: Journal has been rotated since unit was started. Log output is incomple
```

### View the whole journal of a service ###
(`systemctl status <servicename>` only shows the last few lines of the log)
```console
$ journalctl -u ufw -e
```

### Dependency Analysis ###
View dependencies (things that the specified service depend on):
```console
$ systemctl list-dependencies sshd.service
```

Reverse dependencies (things that depend on the specified service):
```console
$ systemctl list-dependencies --reverse multi-user.target
```

### Service Configs ###
- [Long answer][systemctl_man]:
  > reload systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all generators (see systemd.generator(7)), reload all unit files, and 
  > recreate the entire dependency tree. 
  
  Note that it "reloads" unit files, so only those unit files that were already loaded<sup>[1](#footnote01)</sup> (i.e., in memory) 
  will be reloaded. Similarly, the `recreate the entire dependency tree` is a recreation based on the dependencies that are loaded 
  (or reloaded)(?). Any config files that were not already loaded and didn't become dependencies of the reloaded files will remain 
  outside the dependency tree(?).
  ```console
  $ systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

- Start a service right now (and only right now, not on boot)  
  ```console
  $ systemctl start ufw.service
  ```

- Stop a service
  ```console
  $ systemctl stop ufw.service
  ```

- Set a service to run on boot  
  Strictly, `enable` reads the `[Install]` section of the config file, and then updates the various dependencies subdirectories
  with symlinks accordingly. For example, with a setting of `WantedBy=multi-user.target` in `[Install]`, `enable` will ensure that this 
  config file is symlinked from the `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants` directory. Thus, when `multi-user.target` (roughly
  equivalent to runlevel 2) is about to be set (i.e., at boot time), systemd will load its dependencies, which are any services with
  config files symlinked from `.../multi-user.target.wants` or `.../multi-user.target.requires`. Conversely, if the specified config
  file's `[Install]` section did not make it a dependency for anything that loads on boot, `enable` would not do anything.  
  More detail in the [man page][systemd_unit]. 
  After the symlinks have been created, the 'system manager configuration' is reloaded. The system manager configuration reload is
  basically equivalent to `systemctl daemon-reload` for just the specified service (as per the [enable section of the 
  systemctl man][systemctl_man]).
  ```console
  $ systemctl enable ufw.service
  ```


Footnotes
---------
<a name="footnote01">1.</a> "Loaded" means simply that the unit has been loaded from the disk into memory. This happens any time that 
the unit is 'looked at' which includes running `systemctl status <unit>`. Hence any unit that is examined with `systemctl status` will
always appear to be loaded because it is loaded for `status` (and then immediately unloaded). See 
[this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/336890) Linux/Unix Stack Exchange answer and the Unit Garbage Collection section of 
the [systemd.unit][systemd_unit] man page.
